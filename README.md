### About Me ðŸ—½

I'm a software engineer from the USA. I'm into Linux, Python, network security, and other mischief. This is where I keep some of my personal programming projects. Feel free to reach out to me through my web site.

### Projects

Here are some of the more interesting (IMO) projects I've been working on:

* [DurDraw](https://github.com/cmang/durdraw) - Animated Unicode, ANSI and ASCII Art Editor for Linux/Unix/macOS 
* [Gifterm](https://github.com/cmang/gifterm) - Image and animated .GIF viewer for text consoles. Linux/Mac/Windows (kind of)
* [Emojam](https://github.com/cmang/emojam) - A lightweight Emoji picker/keyboard for X-Windows on Linux and Unix-like systems. (Gtk)

* [Synaptweak](https://github.com/cmang/synaptweak) - Synaptics Touchpad Driver Tweaking in Linux (with a GUI) (Qt)

And some smaller, less interesting, or older/abandond projects I've worked on:
